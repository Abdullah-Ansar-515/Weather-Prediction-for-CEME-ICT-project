# Weather-Prediction-for-CEME-ICT-project
Weather prediction program using MLP regressor and trained on historical Data for London from 1979 to 2015. Predicts the parameters for Max, mean, min temperature, cloud cover, pressure, sunshine hours and global radiation. 
This model is trained on historical data for London, UK from 1979 to 2015. As such when using the model input data for london tips: Max temp, mean temp and min temp data can be easily gathered from basic weather sites ,Cloud cover in oktas can be gotten by dividing cloud cover percentage by 12.5 ,Sunshine hours can be taken from this website https://www.weatheronline.co.uk/weather/maps/city?FMM=12&FYY=2024&LYY=2024&WMO=03772&CONT=ukuk&REGION=0003&LAND=UK&ART=SON&R=0&NOREGION=0&LEVEL=162&LANG=en&MOD=MOA ,pressure and precipitation are easily found on basic weather sites ,Global radiation can be found from this website https://en.tutiempo.net/solar-radiation/london.html however the information must be converted to W/m^2 which can be done by dividing by 24
